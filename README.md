# LangChain Project

In this project we are going to see the power of Langchain and its capabilities. It enables applications that can combine LLMs with other sources of computation or knowledge, such as prompt templates, external data, and other tools.

Langchain can help with both tasks by using LLMs to analyze and generate text, and chains to connect LLMs with other components that can provide additional information or functionality.
